# Devcontainer

The easiest way to contribute is to spin up a devcontainer with Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It has all the tools that you require included and doesn't interfere with your system.

## Requirements

- Docker
- VS Code
- Remote - Containers (VS Code extension)

# Fork the Repo

- Fork the Atomic Calendar Repo
- Clone the repository to your computer
- Open the repository in VS Code
- Edit the `.devcontainer/recommended-xxx` files to work with your dev environment (in most cases no changes are required)

When you open this repository with VS code you are asked to "Reopen in Container". This will start the build of the container.

NOTE:
If you don't see the notification, open the command pallet and select `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container`
